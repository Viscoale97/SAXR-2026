Shaping Future Human Connection
Social Augmentation through XR Technologies

CHI 2026 Workshop

This repository accompanies the CHI 2026 workshop Shaping Future Human Connection: Social Augmentation through XR Technologies. It serves as a shared space for materials, resources, and outcomes related to the workshop.

The workshop brings together researchers, designers, and practitioners interested in how Extended Reality (XR) technologies, including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality, can intentionally augment social and emotional cues to support meaningful, inclusive, and ethically responsible human interaction.

Workshop Overview

Human social interaction is evolving alongside advances in communication technologies. Beyond replicating real-world interaction, XR enables social augmentation, the deliberate enhancement, extension, or transformation of social and emotional signals to improve understanding, engagement, and collaboration.

This workshop focuses on the design, evaluation, and ethical implications of Social XR systems. It explores how augmented social cues can be integrated in ways that feel natural, context-sensitive, and scalable, while avoiding over-augmentation or distortion that may undermine trust or social meaning.

Core Themes

The workshop addresses five interrelated themes:

Social augmentation in XR
Design and integration of augmented social cues in VR, AR, and MR across physical and virtual contexts.

AI-supported adaptive and personalized interactions
Use of AI to support context-aware, personalized, and socially intelligent XR systems.

Ethical and responsible system design
Privacy, fairness, transparency, and responsible use of affective and behavioral data.

Accessibility and inclusive Social XR
Approaches that support diverse users, abilities, cultural backgrounds, and communication styles.

Rigorous evaluation methods
Behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures to assess effectiveness, appropriateness, and impact.

Workshop Format

The workshop consists of two 90-minute sessions and includes:

A keynote talk

Mini-Thematic Sessions with joint presentations of accepted extended abstracts

Moderated discussions and collaborative group activities

These activities aim to generate new concepts, design frameworks, and shared research agendas for Social XR.

Repository Structure

This repository will host:

Accepted extended abstracts and presentation materials

Slides and recordings, when available

Shared resources and references

Outputs from group activities and discussions
