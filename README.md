# 🌐 Shaping Future Human Connection: Social Augmentation through XR Technologies  
## 1st Workshop edition at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2026

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the CHI 2026 workshop  
**Shaping Future Human Connection: Social Augmentation through XR Technologies**.

This repository collects materials, resources, and outcomes related to the workshop, and supports collaboration before, during, and after CHI 2026.

## 🧠 About the Workshop

Extended Reality (XR), including **VR**, **AR**, and **MR**, is reshaping how people interact, communicate, and collaborate.

Beyond mirroring real-world interaction, XR enables **social augmentation**: the intentional enhancement of social and emotional cues to improve understanding, engagement, and inclusion.

This workshop brings together researchers, designers, and practitioners to critically explore how social augmentation can be designed, evaluated, and deployed in ways that are **natural**, **ethical**, and **context-sensitive**.

---

## 🎯 Core Themes

We focus on five interconnected themes:

- 🧩 **Social augmentation in XR**  
  Designing and integrating augmented social cues in virtual and mixed environments

- 🤖 **AI-supported adaptive interactions**  
  Personalization, affective computing, and context-aware social feedback

- ⚖️ **Ethical and responsible design**  
  Privacy, fairness, trust, and responsible use of social and affective data

- ♿ **Accessibility and inclusion**  
  Supporting diverse abilities, cultures, and communication styles

- 📊 **Evaluation methods**  
  Behavioral, self-report, and physiological approaches to assessing impact

## 🗓 Workshop Format

The workshop consists of **two 90-minute sessions** and includes:

- 🎤 A keynote talk  
- 📚 Mini-Thematic Sessions with joint presentations of accepted extended abstracts  
- 🛠 Collaborative group activities and moderated discussions  

The goal is to generate **design concepts**, **frameworks**, and **shared research agendas** for Social XR.
